* **Deferred Life Plan**
    * Step one: Do what you *have* to do.
    * Step two: Do what you *want* to do.
* Is there a way to unsubscribe from the Deferred Life Plan and combine what you want to do with what you have to do?
* **Ask yourself**: What would it take for you to do _____ for the rest of your life?
* Drive vs. passion
    * **Drive**: desire to achieve goal with specific payoff
    * **Passion**: pulling towards something you can't resist
* VCs are quite indirect
    * Will never tell you no outright; why burn bridge?
    * In a meeting with multiple VCs, many come in and out; one plays good cop, one plays bad cop but is asking questions and acting on behalf of the **entire audience**
* "Virtual CEO": provide the team with guidance and leadership when necessary; all decisions/action left to the actual CEO
* In the world of startups
    * Business plans should always be flexible as circumstances are constantly changing
    * The main idea or vision should remain constant and should be the base for making all decisions
    * A successful business centers around *people*
    * **Leadership**: where "character and vision combine to empower someone to venture into uncertainty", i.e., allow them to achieve more than they could alone
    * **Management**: "methodical process to produce desired results on time and on budget"
