# NABC 2012: July 6-8, 2012

## Friday, July 6

Landed in Vegas airport. First thing I saw after stepping out of the plane was a group of slot machines. Picked up bags from baggage claim and sat with free wifi until parents got here. Picked up their baggage and then headed out to rental car place, where we could choose any compact! We ended up choosing the Kia Soul, just like when I visited to Rice! Passed by an outlet mall, where my dad *had* to stop at an outlet mall for food. 

Unfortunately, my mom quickly discovered that there was a Coach outlet store, and we were sucked into the never-ending loop of shopping. We ended up having some chicken nuggets and the usual stir-fried, oil-drenched Chinese food. Also went to a store called Perfumania; while my mom browsed the endless collection, I discovered that the after-shave that I use is called "Nautica Sunset Orange." Got a call from Baijayanty Aunty inviting me over for lunch next Sunday. Walked to a few more stores particularly in search of Calvin Klein (I thought they would have some cheap pants). Walked all the way to the end of the stores and turned back only to find it right next to the food court on the other side. Almost bought a "cross-body purse" for Vinita from Coach and then DKNY but couldn't find the correct style. Got back in the car and decided to head to the hotel to check in.

Oh man, that's when things got crazy. The line wrapped around multiple times. I stood in line for a while, but then we got the idea that my dad would stay in line while Mom and I went to go register for NABC itself. Registration didn't take too long, and I visited the youth booth nearby. Seeing as how this is my first NABC in 4 years and I like to wear the T-shirt I got from Toronto every chance I get, I figured it would be a safe bet to go ahead and immediately buy the T-shirt. Got a quick overview of the events for the weekend and then headed back to the hotel check-in area. By the time we got back, we were near the front of the line, and check-in itself went pretty smoothly. We went up to the hotel room, took the obligatory pictures of the room, flung our belongings everywhere, and crashed on the two comfortable beds. I found out that the Youth program had a Groupme group set up, which I thought was a briliant idea. I quickly paid for a 24-hour wifi plan, downloaded the app on my phone, and started chatting in the group. Felt strangely isolated and out of place and later realized that it was only being used by the 21+ admins. Anyways, found out about the opening ceremony and decided to head down to the main hall while my parents were still relaxing.

I somehow managed to find space in the front middle of the auditorium, right between the two sections. It was a great place to photograph and an even better place to witness the opening dance for the ceremony. They even brought in an elephant! I thought it was fake but later realized it was live. Completely blown away. Then came the national anthem for the four major countries that were represented: USA, Canada, Bangladesh, and India. For some reason the woman on the last one messed up on multiple occasions. It was both amusing and slightly embarrassing to witness. Once the performance proceedings were over, the usual Shudh-Bangla introductions, greetings, and welcomes were ushered in by the emcee. Then they brought on a surprise guest: Nirupama Rao, India's ambassador to the US. I was both surprised and delighted as I had seen Paksitan's Amb. to the US last November, Husain Haqqani, and now I got to witness India's counterpart. She gave a generally optimistic speech about the state of the nation and how Bengalis contribute to India's welfare. That was followed up by a fiery political speech from the Finance minister of Bengal about prospects for Bengal and Bengal's role in the improvement of US-India relations. It seemed like he thought that Bengal was poised for a renaissance in the fields of medicine, education, industry, and empowerment. Then we watched a small video message from Mamata Banerjee before going to dinner.

We decided on a small restaurant with crepes, an appropriate choice since we were staying at the Paris hotel. My dad and I were standing in line, and my mom had gone to sit at a table. I was bringing her some napkins when I saw a girl standing at the table, asking me if we were sitting there. Seeing as my mom was sitting there, I was obliged to say "yes", so she and her friends went to a different table, leaving me the conqueror of this battle. Immediately, I etched her face into my mind and gave her the caption of "The Table Thief." I knew our paths would cross again during the course of NABC. In fact, I made it a point to myself to make it happen. I wanted to savor this victory.
