# Ephemeral
### September 19, 2011

Into a dream I enter  
To an exciting, new world.  
Sounds, sights, senses  
All rushing at me.  

She turns the corner,  
A slight trickle of lavender,  
That ethereal lavender,  
Flowing in all directions.  

Her radiance is unbearable;  
I turn my eyes to the shadows.  
A shock flows down my spine  
As perfection passes by, unnoticing.  

Each day,  
I long for this moment.  
Just one moment with her.  
One breath to remember.  

From a dream I awake  
Back to a familiar place.  
Sounds, sights, senses  
All coming back to me.
