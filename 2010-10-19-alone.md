# Alone: A Perspective
### October 19, 2010

Here I am. An outsider. The world does not greet me. The world does not know me. I am alone. Murmurs, jumbles of conversation surround me. Happy faces share a celebration of joy. But not me—I am alone. What is it like to be one of them, one in the crowd of normalcy? I will not know. How could I? It is no physical barrier that separates me from this wave of activity that always seems to be at high tide. Yet still I feel removed, isolated, caved. Why? What is this shell that is discomfort? Everything surrounding me is foreign, nothing familiar. Perhaps I shouldn’t have left the Cave.
